- 👋 Hi, I’m @brockyKris
- 👀 I’m interested in mobile app. development, as a GCIT.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as a student of veterinary sciences, a birds specialist.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ecology, some botany, mainly zoological ornithology and water (hydrology) projects. Water projects can be anything from river management, to water supply, drainage and sewerage infrastructure, with experience in critical infrastructure and media.
- 📫 How to reach me ... to be advised.
